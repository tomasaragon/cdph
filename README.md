## Decision-making is our most important activity

"A decision is a choice between two or more
alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation
of resources."[^dqbook] "...your decision-making is the
single most important thing you have control over
that will help you achieve your goals."[^htd] Every
decision has causal assumptions, predictions, and
opportunity costs—the lost benefits of the better
option(s) not chosen or not considered.

In service of our values and goals, [human decision intelligence](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/t/human-decision-intelligence) (Figure 1) is using ethics,
science, and technology to improve team decision-making and outcomes in the face of **uncertainty**,
**trade-offs**, and **time constraints**. HDI prioritizes
improving human decision-making capabilities.
