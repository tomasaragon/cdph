## Decision-making is our most important activity

"A decision is a choice between two or more
alternatives that involves an irrevocable allocation
of resources."[^dqbook] "...your decision-making is the
single most important thing you have control over
that will help you achieve your goals."[^htd] Every
decision has causal assumptions, predictions, and
opportunity costs—the lost benefits of the better
option(s) not chosen or not considered.

In service of our values and goals, [human decision intelligence](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/t/human-decision-intelligence) (Figure 1) is using ethics,
science, and technology to improve team decision-making and outcomes in the face of uncertainty,
trade-offs, and time constraints. HDI prioritizes
improving human decision-making capabilities.

The CDPH Office of Policy and Planning will have a Decision Intelligence Unit (DIU) to develop, implement, and improve strategic decision-making methods for high stakes, high cost, and/or high impact public health decisions. Methods will include cost-benefit and cost-effective analyses, and decision analysis. These positions have permanent funding. We will secure grants and develop collaborative partnerships with academic institutions. 

-	Leaders and managers as "decision architects": Design and improve of team decision meetings that incorporate cognitive psychology and decision quality. See Annie Duke, 2020.[^htd]
-	Methods to optimize policy, budgetary, or prioritization decisions: cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses; and priority setting and resource allocation (PSRA). See Seixas, 2021.[^bvs]
-	Decision making under uncertainty, including [deep uncertainty](https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP67833.html) (ie, risks not calculable)
-	[Computational algorithms for decision making](https://algorithmsbook.com/) (using Bayesian networks (including decision networks [influence diagrams]), Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), Reinforcement Learning, Agent-based modeling)

Seixas, François Dionne, and Craig Mitton, “Practices of Decision Making in Priority Setting and Resource Allocation: A Scoping Review and Narrative Synthesis of Existing Frameworks,” Health Economics Review 11, no. 1 (January 7, 2021): 2, https://doi.org/10.1186/s13561-020-00300-0.


The DIU will have a trans-disciplinary team:

-	Health economist with expertise in population health cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses
-	Behavioral economist with expertise in decision implementation science
-	Computational decision scientist with expertise in programming (Julia, Python, R)
-	Population health data scientist
-	Biostatistician

The DIU is part of CDPH's longer term strategy to build our capability in population health data science (Table) and to move us to Levels 4 and 5.

|Level | Analysis | Description|
| :---: | --- | --- |
|1 | Description | a. surveillance and early detection of events|
| | | b. prevalence and incidence of risks and outcomes|
|2 | Prediction | a. early prediction and targeting of interventions|
|3| Explanation[^a] | a. discovery and testing of new causal pathways|
| | | b. estimation of intervention efficacy/effectiveness|
|4| Simulation | a. modeling for epidemiologic or decision insights|
|5| Optimization[^b] | a. optimizing decision, effectiveness, or efficiency metrics|

Here is a graphical depiction of the Table.[^bayesialab] We aim to embrace our "reasoning" to make better decisions.
